# Performing the Nation as Commodity

This repository hosts the paper **“Performing the Nation as Commodity”**, a study of how **Chinese cyber-nationalism** is performed and commodified in online controversies surrounding the video game *Wuchang: Fallen Feathers*.

The paper examines how users collectively stage nationalism as a kind of **ritualized performance** in digital spaces, where visibility, emotional expression, and platform metrics become part of the “commodity form” of the nation itself.

## 1. Project overview

### Research focus

The paper asks, broadly:

- How do online users **perform the nation** in reaction to a commercial cultural product (the game *Wuchang: Fallen Feathers*)?
- In what ways do cyber-nationalist practices resemble **commodified rituals**—loops of accusation, copying, and amplification tied to platform visibility?
- How do platform architectures (recommendation systems, metrics, comment cultures) shape which nationalist narratives become **visible, legitimate, or “viral”**?

The project sits at the intersection of:

- **Digital nationalism / cyber-nationalism**
- **Platform studies and visibility politics**
- **Performance, ritual, and commodification**
- **Discourse and cultural analysis of Chinese digital publics**
